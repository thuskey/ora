README.Debian for quake3-data
-----------------------------

This package facilitates the installation of the Quake III data onto your
Debian system.

If you upgrade or reinstall this package, you currently need to have the
CD-ROM and downloaded files mounted and in the same location as they were
for the first install, otherwise the installer will break. If you want to
change the location of installables, then use dpkg-reconfigure quake3-data
before upgrading.

The downloaded pointrelease file WILL NOT be deleted by this script. The
author of this package thinks this behaviour is useful if you want to
reconfigure or reinstall this package.
